    "content": "It has been our goal since founding the club in the fall of 2020 that one day The Robotics Club would be a mainstay in the Wake Forest community. Over the course of the last semester, our leadership team has been working towards this goal by engaging in the new university club chartering process. We are pleased to announce that our club's provisional chartering has been granted! This means we will now be an official university organization that can be found on pages like The Link. As such, membership requests for The Link will be going out shortly to all active members. We would like to thank all of our members, as well as the Office of Student Engagement and Student Organizations Council, for helping us reach this milestone! With your continued support, we are excited to see how The Robotics Club will grow over the coming years."
